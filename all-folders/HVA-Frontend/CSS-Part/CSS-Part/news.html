        Olympic Games, Sports festival. In ancient Greece it was a Panhellenic
        festival held every fourth year and made up of contests of sports,
        music, and literature. Since 1896 the name has been used for a modified
        revival of the ancient Games, consisting of international athletic
        contests held at four-year intervals.

        The original Games included footraces, the discus and javelin throws,
        the long jump, boxing, wrestling, the pentathlon, and chariot races.
        After the subjugation of Greece by Rome, the Games declined; they were
        finally abolished about ad 400. They were revived in the late 19th
        century through efforts led in part by Pierre, baron de Coubertin; the
        first modern Games were held in Athens. The first Winter Games were held
        in 1924. The direction of the modern Olympic movement and the regulation
        of the Games are vested in the International Olympic Committee,
        headquartered at Lausanne, Switz.
